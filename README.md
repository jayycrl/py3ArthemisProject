A Snake game made in Python for our first year Programming Logic &amp; Design class.

## About the game
Snake is a game where you control a snake, moving around the screen and eating food that randomly spawns. When the snake eats food, it grows longer and you get more points. The goal is to grow as long as possible without bumping into yourself or the walls around the playing field.
